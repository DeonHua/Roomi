# Roomi

## The App
Roomi is a web-app to help out roomies! We've built features to help make your lives as roommates easier.
What does Roomi do?
* Splits the cost of groceries/bills amongst roommates, and saves the balence for you.
* A to-do list, for those chores that need to be done and groceries that need to be bought
* A message board for important things you want to share with each other

How do you use Roomi?

Simple enough. Just sign up and you'll get a Group # to share with your roommates. Get them to signup as well, and you're all set.

We hope you like it!

Made with love.


## Dev stuff
Built in [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor), with [Angular-Meteor](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor) and [Materialize](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize).

Notes about meteor:

All angular partials should end in .ng.html to avoid conflicts with meteor templatng.

To run the server:

```
$ meteor
```
then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
the database operates on `http://localhost:3001`
